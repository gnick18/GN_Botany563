# GN_Botany563
Class repo for Botany 563 to store my scripts and md files.

Any side projects will be in their own file storage location. The main project folder will have my own personal data and all of the script notes that are used in the process of running analysis on said data.

## For the reviewer of my project rough draft
In order to navigate to the main document that has info on my project rough draft **go into MainProject and then click on the notes markdown file**. 
If you would like to make comments or edits I would prefer if you forked my repo and pushed a file with your comments, or just email them to me at gnickles@wisc.edu
